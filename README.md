# Kiran Foundation
The Kiran Foundation is a non-profit organisation based in India. Our work empowers socially, physically and financially disadvantaged sections of society, giving wings to their dreams and hopes.
Knowledge, Transparency, Discipline and Compassion are the foundation of our mission and software plays a key role in it.
